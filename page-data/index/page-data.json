The React frontend implements component-based UI design with custom hooks and Context API for efficient state management, delivering an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for task organization. The Node.js backend with Express provides RESTful API endpoints for complete CRUD operations, incorporating middleware for request validation and error handling. The application utilizes MongoDB for flexible document-based storage of tasks with their associated metadata, priorities, and relationships, while implementing JWT-based authentication to ensure secure user sessions and data privacy. Key features include customizable task categorization, deadline management with smart reminders, and priority-based filtering capabilities. The architecture employs a modular design pattern with clear separation between UI components, business logic, and data access layers, facilitating maintainability and enabling future feature extensions.
