Focused on advancing Large Language Models' understanding of time, this project developed a multi-step inference pipeline utilizing LLaMA 3.1. By integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, symbolic reasoning, and temporal graph construction, the system markedly improved the ability to accurately infer event sequences, durations, and dependencies from unstructured text. Robust preprocessing and evaluation techniques, measured by Exact Match and F1-scores, confirmed its superior performance over baseline models in complex temporal reasoning tasks.
