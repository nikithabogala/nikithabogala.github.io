This project involved developing a sophisticated Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agent designed to master the game of Pacman. Initially relying on random policy simulations, the agent was significantly enhanced by incorporating an evaluation function, enabling more strategic action choices. Tested across diverse Pacman environments featuring varied layouts and ghost behaviors, both the basic and enhanced MCTS agents statistically demonstrated superior performance in scores and win rates compared to traditional depth-limited Alpha-Beta and Expectimax agents.
