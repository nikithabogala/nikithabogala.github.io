This project involved building and deploying a high-performance, real-time face recognition system hosted on AWS. Utilizing FastAPI and Docker, the system achieved low-latency processing and dynamic scaling capabilities, similar to requirements found in high-speed financial platforms. Its fully containerized architecture employed AWS ECR for image storage and AWS Lambda for serverless function execution, complemented by auto-scaling logic to efficiently manage EC2 instance resources based on real-time workload demands.
