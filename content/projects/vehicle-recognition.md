This project involved developing an advanced Vehicle Number Plate Recognition system utilizing deep learning and computer vision techniques. Implementing YOLOv8's object detection capabilities enabled precise localization of license plates within complex traffic scenes with high accuracy across various lighting conditions and vehicle types. The multi-stage pipeline incorporated custom image segmentation algorithms to isolate and normalize detected plate regions, while integration with EasyOCR facilitated robust character recognition even with challenging fonts and partial occlusions. The system's modular architecture separated detection, segmentation, and recognition components, allowing for independent optimization of each stage and easier maintenance. Performance testing demonstrated reliable recognition in real-world scenarios, with the implementation showcasing practical applications of convolutional neural networks for automated vehicle identification in traffic management systems, parking solutions, and security applications. This project demonstrates effective application of computer vision principles and deep learning models to solve complex real-world image recognition challenges.
