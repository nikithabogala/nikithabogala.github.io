This project involved developing a responsive entertainment platform using ASP.NET MVC architecture and C# for seamless movie discovery and trailer streaming. Implementing modular Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services with the Repository pattern enabled efficient data access abstraction and third-party API integration. The system features secure user authentication with password encryption and cookie-based session management, complemented by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for differentiated user and staff privileges. The application's N-tier architecture ensured clean separation of concerns, while asynchronous API calls delivered real-time movie information retrieval without compromising user experience. This comprehensive solution demonstrates practical implementation of modern web development principles, secure authentication systems, and effective integration with external media services.
