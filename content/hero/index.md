👩‍🎓 I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/)(July'25), providing me with a solid groundwork to tackle complex challenges.

👩‍💻 I have worked as a Software Engineer at [Barclays](https://www.barclays.com/) and [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/), where I developed high-performance microservices, automated workflows, and secure data pipelines.

I have about 5+ years of academic experience in the field of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

I'm actively seeking a summer 2025 internship/full-time role where I can contribute my skills in coding and finding efficient solutions.

Let’s innovate the future together!
