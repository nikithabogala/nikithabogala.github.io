- Led the transformation of legacy securities trade processing systems into a modern Java/Spring Boot microservices architecture, resulting in a 30% improvement in transaction processing speed while maintaining seamless compatibility with SWIFT messaging protocols used in global financial networks.

- Architected a high-throughput distributed back-end infrastructure leveraging Java and Spring Boot with Kafka as the message broker backbone, enabling real-time data ingestion and millisecond-level processing latency for securities trade operations in volatile market conditions.

- Created an intelligent payments automation workflow that integrated IBM MQ for guaranteed message delivery, OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication mechanisms, and comprehensive JSON validation, which reduced manual processing requirements by 40% and virtually eliminated payment reconciliation errors.

- Worked cross-functionally with operations, risk management, and compliance specialists to implement robust security controls including end-to-end encryption and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), achieving a 35% reduction in security vulnerabilities during penetration testing cycles.

- Throughout my tenure at Barclays, I applied advanced expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Kafka, SQL, RESTful APIs, IBM MQ, OAuth 2.0, JSON validation, encryption technologies, RBAC, and secure SDLC practices to deliver mission-critical financial processing systems for global markets.
