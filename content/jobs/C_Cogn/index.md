- Built and optimized high-performance microservices using Java 11 and Spring Boot that successfully processed between 50,000-100,000 transactions per second while maintaining 99.99% uptime for critical telecommunications systems handling customer data and service requests.

- Constructed secure and resilient data ingestion pipelines utilizing RESTful APIs with OAuth2 authentication protocols and custom validation logic, which reduced integration errors by 25% and significantly enhanced overall data integrity across interconnected systems.

- Executed a comprehensive containerization strategy leveraging Docker alongside Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines, automating the entire software delivery lifecycle from build through testing to deployment, transitioning release cycles from multi-day processes to just hours.

- During my role at Verizon, I utilized my technical skills in Java 11, Spring Boot, RESTful API development, OAuth2 security implementation, Docker containerization, Jenkins CI/CD, SQL optimization, and Agile development methodologies to deliver scalable telecommunications solutions.
